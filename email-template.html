            <h1>Michael Scott Daily Quotes</h1>
            <p>
                "Friends joke with one another. 'Hey, you're poor.' 'Hey, your mom's dead. That's what friends do."

                "It's a good thing Russia doesn't exist anymore."

                "You cheated on me? When I specifically asked you not to?"

                "It just seems awfully mean. But sometimes, the ends justify the mean."

                "Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but,
                basically, you  make someone think the opposite of what you believe, and that trick them
                into doing something stupid. Works like a charm."
